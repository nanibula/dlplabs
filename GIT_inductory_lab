What Happend in this Lab;
--> First we have created india directory( considering one employee is working from india)
-->we have created a file and pushed to github (indian employee has done some work and pushed his file to github)
-->We have created america directory (considering one employee is working from america)
-->Now we pulled the file from github (after pulling the file from github, american employee will get all the work done by the indian employee)

Note: 
Instead of creating instances you can create seperate directories and use them as git repos
